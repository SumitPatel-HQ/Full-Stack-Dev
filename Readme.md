# 🚀 A Journey Towards Becoming a Full Stack Developer

Welcome to my learning journey in full stack development! This repository serves as a living document of my progress, projects, and the resources I discover as I work toward becoming a proficient full stack developer.

## 🌐 What is Full Stack Development?

Full stack development refers to the ability to work across the entire technology stack of an application — both front-end and back-end — including deployment and maintenance:

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue  
- **Back-end**: Server-side languages and environments like Node.js, Python, or Java; working with databases and building APIs  
- **DevOps**: Deployment, version control (Git/GitHub), CI/CD, testing, and cloud infrastructure

## 🛤️ My Learning Path

This repository will track my journey as I learn, experiment, and build real-world projects using various tools and technologies across the stack.

## 🎯 My Goals

- ✅ Master modern front-end technologies and responsive UI design  
- ✅ Build scalable and efficient back-end services  
- ✅ Learn database management (SQL & NoSQL)  
- ✅ Understand DevOps practices for deployment and scalability  
- ✅ Create a strong portfolio of full-stack applications  
- ✅ Contribute meaningfully to open-source projects
